[Gatsby v3](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v3.0/) was
launched today at [Gatsby Conf](https://gatsbyconf.com/). The two features that
stood out to me were
[incremental builds](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v3.0/#incremental-builds-in-oss)
and
[fast refresh](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v3.0/#fast-refresh).
Both features should result in a better DX for consumers of my
[Gatsby themes](https://github.com/maiertech/gatsby-themes). So I gave it a try
and upgraded my themes.

My starting point was the
[migration guide from v2 to v3](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v2-to-v3/).
I started by upgrading Gatsby to v3 for the two example sites with which I
develop my themes
[in this monorepo](https://github.com/maiertech/gatsby-themes). I ran

```bash
yarn workspace core-themes-example dev
```

and saw this:

```bash
$ gatsby develop
/home/node/workspace/gatsby-themes/node_modules/gatsby-recipes/node_modules/graphql-compose/lib/utils/toInputType.js:100
        throw new Error(`${`Can not convert field '${tc.getTypeName()}.${fieldName}' to InputType` + '\nIt should be ObjectType or InterfaceType, but
got \n'}${(0, _misc.inspect)(fc.type)}`);
        ^

Error: Can not convert field 'GatsbyPlugin.options' to InputType
...
```

OK, long shot to hope that upgrading to Gatsby v3 without upgrading any plugins
does not break anything. I ran

```bash
yarn outdated
```

which showed me a long list of plugins that needed to be upgraded:

```bash
yarn outdated v1.22.5

I upgraded all plugins with a major version change and my site launched without
errors:

```bash
You can now view coding-garden in the browser.
⠀
  http://localhost:8000/
⠀
View GraphiQL, an in-browser IDE, to explore your site's data and schema
⠀
  http://localhost:8000/___graphql
⠀
Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use gatsby build
```

This is quite impressive for a major version upgrade. Nothing really broke in
both example sites. But there were a ton of warnings. But this was expected
after skimming over the migration guide. I tackled all warnings one by one,
starting with this type of warning:

```bash
warn Plugin @maiertech/gatsby-theme-posts-core is not compatible with your gatsby version 3.0.0 - It requires gatsby@^2.24.77
```

As mentioned in the
[migration guide section "For Plugin Maintainers"](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v2-to-v3/#for-plugin-maintainers),
`gatsby` in `peerDependencies` needs to be bumped to v3 for all plugins (and
themes):

```json
"peerDependencies": {
  "gatsby": "^3.0.0",
  "react": "^16.14.0 || ^17.0.1",
  "react-dom": "^16.14.0 || ^17.0.1"
},
```

First warning eliminated. The next type of warning was a deprecation warning:

```bash
warn Deprecation warning: `@nodeInterface` extension is deprecated and will be removed in Gatsby v4. Use interface inheritance instead.
To upgrade replace the old format:
  interface `Page` @nodeInterface
with the new one (in `createTypes` action of schema customization API):
  interface `Page` implements Node
Read more about schema customization here:
https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/graphql-data-layer/schema-customization/
```

Gatsby v3 does not just pull the rug from under your feet and eliminate APIs.
Instead, it offers a transition period until the release of Gatsby v4 for legacy
APIs to be phased out.
[Migration guide section `@nodeInterface`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v2-to-v3/#nodeinterface)
details this warning. I went ahead and eliminiated all occurrences of
`@nodeInterface` as explained in the guide. Second warning eliminated.

The next error was triggered by Webpack, which complained that I was trying to
use `path` from Node’s API in the browser during development:

```bash
ERROR #98124  WEBPACK

Generating development JavaScript bundle failed

Can't resolve 'path' in '/home/node/workspace/gatsby-themes/packages/gatsby-helpers'

If you're trying to use a package make sure that 'path' is installed. If you're trying to use a local file make sure that the path is correct.

BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
        - add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { "path": require.resolve("path-browserify") }'
        - install 'path-browserify'
If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:
        resolve.fallback: { "path": false }

File: ../../packages/gatsby-helpers/index.js:12:16
```

This error is shown because I use
[@maiertech/gatsby-helpers](https://github.com/maiertech/gatsby-themes/tree/master/packages/gatsby-helpers),
in which some helper functions use the Node API. One of them, `createPath`, uses
Node’s `path` and runs in one example site in the browser during development.
The solution to eliminating this error is outlined in above error message and
the
[migration guide section about Webpack 5 config](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v2-to-v3/#webpack-5-node-configuration-changed-nodefs-nodepath-)
tells you how to load a polyfill:

```js
module.exports.onCreateWebpackConfig = ({ actions }) => {
  actions.setWebpackConfig({
    resolve: {
      alias: {
        path: require.resolve('path-browserify'),
      },
      fallback: { fs: false },
    },
  });
};
```

Using a polyfill is not ideal, but it did trick and eliminated the error. The
next warning was specific to one of my themes, which wires up
[Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/):

```bash
warn Plugin gatsby-plugin-theme-ui is not compatible with your gatsby version 3.0.0 - It requires gatsby@^2.13.1
```

gatsby-plugin-theme-ui’s `peerDependencies` has not yet been upgraded to Gatsby
v3. Following the advice in
[migration guide section "Handling dependencies for plugins that are not yet updated"](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v2-to-v3/#handling-dependencies-for-plugins-that-are-not-yet-updated)
I had not much choice other than ignore the warning since gatsby-plugin-theme-ui
is outside my control. Since the plugin works fine with Gatsby v3, not a deal
breaker.

Then I released new versions for all my themes and upgraded my digital garden to
Gatsby v3 and the latest
[@maiertech/gatsby-theme-digital-garden](https://github.com/maiertech/gatsby-themes/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-digital-garden),
which I had just released. But I ran into another error:

```bash
yarn run v1.22.5
$ gatsby develop

 ERROR

Unexpected key "pageData" found in preloadedState argument passed to createStore. Expected to find one of the known reducer keys instead: "nodes",
"logs", "pages", "redirects", "schema", "definitions", "staticQueryComponents", "status", "webpack", "webpackCompilationHash", "config", "lastAction",
"jobsV2", "pageDataStats", "components", "babelrc", "jobs", "nodesByType", "program", "resolvedNodesCache", "nodesTouched", "flattenedPlugins",
"pendingPageDataWrites", "schemaCustomization", "inferenceMetadata", "staticQueriesByTemplate", "queries", "visitedPages", "html". Unexpected keys will
be ignored.
```

This looked very much like a cache problem and one

```bash
yarn clean
```

later, the upgrade to Gatsby v3 was complete.

I think the Gatsby team did a great job with the v2 to v3 migration guide,
because it covered everything I needed to know for the upgrade. For a normal
Gatsby site that uses no theme or one of the
[official themes](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/themes), I would expect that
upgrading to Gatsby v3 should work without any issues.
