This post discusses the concept of
[hoisting](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/lexicon#hoisting), which is a staple of
[Yarn 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/). [Yarn 2](https://yarnpkg.com/)'s
[Plug'n'Play](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp) has addressed most issues around
hoisting, making this post partially obsolete as soon as you move to Yarn 2. In
this post Yarn (without version number) refers to Yarn 1. This post lays the
foundation for understanding a common pitfall with conflicting dependencies when
using multiple Gatsby themes in one site.

## Hoisting

Yarn converts dependencies from a `package.json` into a tree by resolving them
recursively. An un-optimized dependency tree can be quite complex and many
levels deep to reflect dependencies of dependencies. Some packages show up
multiple times in the tree, possibly at conflicting versions. Yarn uses hoisting
to optimize (or rather deduplicate) the dependency tree by removing as many
nodes as possible. [Yarn's docs](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/lexicon#hoisting)
state that "There isn't a single way to decide how to transform the tree, and
different package managers make different tradeoffs (some optimize for package
popularity, package size, highest versions, ...). For this reason, no guarantee
can be made regarding the final hoisting layout - except that packages will
always be able to access the dependencies they listed in their manifests."

The docs do not describe Yarn's hoisting algorithm, but mention certain
[hoisting guarantees](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/05/31/determinism/).
The conclusion is that you should not expect your `node_modules` folder to have
a specific layout. As you will see later in this post, small changes in
dependencies can cause big changes in the layout of `node_modules`. Another
thing to keep in mind is that hoisting packages only works when package versions
are compatible in a [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) sense, i.e. they
need to have the same major version number (but not 0).

## `yarn why`

Once a Yarn install is complete, you can use
[`yarn why`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/why/) to figure out what
Yarn did with specific packages. Let's look at an example. I ran

```bash
yarn why @maiertech/gatsby-theme-posts-core
```

on a Gatsby test site:

```bash
yarn why v1.22.5
[1/4] Why do we have the module "@maiertech/gatsby-theme-posts-core"...?
[2/4] Initialising dependency graph...
[3/4] Finding dependency...
[4/4] Calculating file sizes...
=> Found "@maiertech/gatsby-theme-posts-core@0.8.0"
info Reasons this module exists
   - "@maiertech#gatsby-theme-digital-garden" depends on it
   - Hoisted from "@maiertech#gatsby-theme-digital-garden#@maiertech#gatsby-theme-posts-core"
info Disk size without dependencies: "108KB"
info Disk size with unique dependencies: "4.18MB"
info Disk size with transitive dependencies: "164.24MB"
info Number of shared dependencies: 374
Done in 1.61s.
```

Yarn tells us that it found package
[@maiertech/gatsby-theme-posts-core](https://github.com/maiertech/gatsby-themes/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-posts-core)
at version 0.8.0, which is a dependency of
[@maiertech/gatsby-theme-digitial-garden](https://github.com/maiertech/gatsby-themes/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-digital-garden).
It also tells us that it hoisted this version, which makes sense because
@maiertech/gatsby-theme-posts-core is used only once in the entire project.

Let's look at another `yarn why` output from a different repository, this time
for package
[@maiertech/gatsby-theme-pages-core](https://github.com/maiertech/gatsby-themes/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-pages-core):

```bash
yarn why v1.22.5
[1/4] Why do we have the module "@maiertech/gatsby-theme-pages-core"...?
[2/4] Initialising dependency graph...
[3/4] Finding dependency...
[4/4] Calculating file sizes...
=> Found "@maiertech/gatsby-theme-pages-core@0.5.0"
info Has been hoisted to "@maiertech/gatsby-theme-pages-core"
info This module exists because it's specified in "dependencies".
info Disk size without dependencies: "76KB"
info Disk size with unique dependencies: "8.15MB"
info Disk size with transitive dependencies: "76KB"
info Number of shared dependencies: 379
=> Found "@made-up-scope/gatsby-theme-base#@maiertech/gatsby-theme-pages-core@0.4.0"
info This module exists because "@made-up-scope#gatsby-theme-base" depends on it.
info Disk size without dependencies: "72KB"
info Disk size with unique dependencies: "8.14MB"
info Disk size with transitive dependencies: "72KB"
info Number of shared dependencies: 379
Done in 6.32s.
```

This time Yarn looks for nodes with @maiertech/gatsby-theme-pages-core in the
dependecy tree. There is version 0.5.0 specified in `dependencies` in
`package.json`. And there is version 0.4.0, which is a dependency of
@made-up-scope/gatsby-theme-base. Yarn also says that it hoisted version 0.5.0.
Since versions 0.5.0 and 0.4.0 are pre-1.0, semantic versioning assertions do
not apply, i.e. version 0.5.0 is not a drop-in replacement for version 0.4.0.
Therefore, the `yarn.lock` file contains two separate entries for versions 0.5.0
and 0.4.0:

```bash:yarn.lock
...
"@maiertech/gatsby-theme-pages-core@^0.4.0":
  version "0.4.0"
  resolved "https://registry.yarnpkg.com/@maiertech/gatsby-theme-pages-core/-/gatsby-theme-pages-core-0.4.0.tgz#d7226567f882c009c51415361666c90449637712"
  integrity sha512-ohzfpaL6Q4hZX0AZ8hS0tUqY+w6I6mr+cyYFTDqqAMPY3GBZPexFFgxCCspd1sAMJqaWgBmcDH6BkQYDXVymDA==
  dependencies:
  ...
"@maiertech/gatsby-theme-pages-core@^0.5.0":
  version "0.5.0"
  resolved "https://registry.yarnpkg.com/@maiertech/gatsby-theme-pages-core/-/gatsby-theme-pages-core-0.5.0.tgz#f8cc30886b85e635b3b0b952d6f488cfcb20f0ce"
  integrity sha512-x+A8idApFORR5vD8aTTDEqYi83OvcZL9Tdt168Cih9o+UbYWXb8ne+T+V7klHjnZ63UL0R4F908vo3yTeIVbNw==
  dependencies:
  ...
...
```

Note that `yarn.lock` does not tell us which packages were hoisted.

Let's look at another example. This time we look at what `yarn why` tells us
about package [browserslist](https://browserl.ist/), a dependency that is used
by many packages:

```bash
yarn why v1.22.5
[1/4] Why do we have the module "browserslist"...?
[2/4] Initialising dependency graph...
[3/4] Finding dependency...
[4/4] Calculating file sizes...
=> Found "browserslist@4.16.3"
info Reasons this module exists

info Disk size with unique dependencies: "3.81MB"
info Disk size with transitive dependencies: "3.81MB"
info Number of shared dependencies: 5
Done in 0.96s.
```

Yarn tells us that browserslist is a direct dependency of package
[gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and it appears a few more times in the
dependecy tree. All specified versions of browserslist are compatible with
version 4.16.3, which was the latest version when I created this output.
Therefore, Yarn hoisted version 4.16.3. The entry for browserslist in
`yarn.lock` reveals which version declarations it actually found, all of them
compatible with 4.16.3:

```bash:yarn.lock
...
browserslist@^4.0.0, browserslist@^4.12.0, browserslist@^4.12.2, browserslist@^4.14.5, browserslist@^4.16.1:
  version "4.16.3"
  resolved "https://registry.yarnpkg.com/browserslist/-/browserslist-4.16.3.tgz#340aa46940d7db878748567c5dea24a48ddf3717"
  integrity sha512-vIyhWmIkULaq04Gt93txdh+j02yX/JzlyhLYbV3YQCn/zvES3JnY7TifHHvvr1w5hTDluNKMkV05cs4vy8Q7sw==
  dependencies:
    caniuse-lite "^1.0.30001181"
    colorette "^1.2.1"
    electron-to-chromium "^1.3.649"
    escalade "^3.1.1"
    node-releases "^1.1.70"
...
```

Let's look at one more example. This time I installed package browserslist in my
dependencies and pinned it to outdated version 4.16.2. This changed things quite
a bit:

```bash
[1/4] Why do we have the module "browserslist"...?
[2/4] Initialising dependency graph...
[3/4] Finding dependency...
[4/4] Calculating file sizes...
=> Found "browserslist@4.16.2"
info Has been hoisted to "browserslist"
info This module exists because it's specified in "dependencies".
info Disk size without dependencies: "124KB"
info Disk size with unique dependencies: "3.81MB"
info Disk size with transitive dependencies: "3.81MB"
info Number of shared dependencies: 5
=> Found "gatsby#browserslist@4.16.3"
info This module exists because "gatsby" depends on it.
info Disk size without dependencies: "124KB"
info Disk size with unique dependencies: "3.81MB"
info Disk size with transitive dependencies: "3.81MB"
info Number of shared dependencies: 5
...
8 more instances omitted.
...
=> Found "stylehacks#browserslist@4.16.3"
info This module exists because "gatsby#optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin#cssnano#cssnano-preset-default#postcss-merge-longhand#stylehacks" depends on it.
info Disk size without dependencies: "124KB"
info Disk size with unique dependencies: "3.81MB"
info Disk size with transitive dependencies: "3.81MB"
info Number of shared dependencies: 5
Done in 1.96s.
```

Yarn hoisted version 4.16.2, which is the version I pinned in my dependencies.
In all other instances where browserslist is further down in the dependency tree
(10 total), Yarn stores a copy of version 4.16.3. This means that pinning one
dependency to a specific version triggerd a massive change in the layout of
`node_modules`. There are now 10 nodes with 10 copies of version 4.16.3 and one
hoisted node with one copy of version 4.16.2 (instead of just one hoisted node
with one copy of version 4.16.3). The bottom line from this observation is that
you should never make assumptions about the layout of `node_modules` in your
packages.

A quick look at `yarn.lock` reveals that it has now two entries for browserslist
for versions 4.16.2. and 4.16.3:

```bash:yarn.lock
...
browserslist@4.16.2:
  version "4.16.2"
  resolved "https://registry.yarnpkg.com/browserslist/-/browserslist-4.16.2.tgz#f79d67cd37e8d80ff0835fe7bc456e406fb1582c"

  version "4.16.3"
  resolved "https://registry.yarnpkg.com/browserslist/-/browserslist-4.16.3.tgz#340aa46940d7db878748567c5dea24a48ddf3717"

```

## Conclusions

- Yarn tries to eliminate as many nodes as possible from the dependency tree by
  hoisting as many packages as possible.
- Hoisting works best if you
  [specify your dependencies with a caret (`^`)](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#dependencies).
  The more restrictive you are, e.g. by pinning dependencies, the more
  constriants you create for Yarn that make it hard to hoist packages.
- You can debug issues with dependencies with a combination of running
  `yarn why` on certain packages and looking at `yarn.lock`.
- Hoisting can conceal missing dependencies. Hoisted dependencies can be
  imported anywhere. If you happen to forget to declare a dependency in your
  `package.json` and then import it, it might still work when Yarn happens to
  hoist this dependency from another node in the dependency tree. But it might
  stop working unexpectedly, when the layout of `node_modules` changes because
  of something as minor as a pinned dependency.
- Yarn always
  [honors its basic guarantees for dependencies declared as `dependencies`, `devDependencies` and `peerDependencies` in `package.json`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/blog/2018/04/18/dependencies-done-right/),
  i.e. when you import a dependency, Yarn will always deliver a version
  compatible with what you specified.
