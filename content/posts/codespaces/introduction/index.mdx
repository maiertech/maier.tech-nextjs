[GitHub](https://github.com/) launched
[Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) in limited public beta at
[GitHub Satellite 2020](https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more/).
Codespaces come with the the promise of lowering the barrier to contributing to
GitHub repositories. It would be a huge win if contributors (or co-workers)
could spin up an instance of VS Code in a browser with all required plugins and
configurations in place, fully ready for their first commit. What previously
might have taken several hours to several days, would now be reduced to just a
few minutes, which is the time it takes to spin up a development container.

I have been using GitHub Codespaces for both work and side projects over the
past few months. There were some rough edges, but overall Codespaces did not
disappoint. In this post I will explain the underlying technology and discuss
the impact of Codespaces on making contributions to GitHub repositories so much
easier.

## Save your development environment to your GitHub repository

The idea of Codespaces is simple: configure a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
container and add VS Code configurations and plugins to this container. Then add
the corresponding configuration files to your GitHub repository. Anyone can now
run a pre-configured development container (with the repository cloned inside)
in their browser or in a locally installed VS Code.

You do not have to be a Docker expert to use Codespaces. The
[vscode-dev-containers](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers)
repository is a collection of Docker images for common technology stacks. E.g.
there is a
[javascript-node](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/master/containers/javascript-node)
image that comes with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and
[Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed. You can check what
stacks are available in the
[containers](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/master/containers)
directory, which contains a sub-directory for each image with a `README.md` and
a `.devcontainer` sub-directory that contains the following files:

- `base.Dockerfile`: Dockerfile from which an image for the
  [Microsoft Container Registry (MCR)](https://github.com/microsoft/containerregistry)
  has been created.
- `Dockerfile`: a Dockerfile that is used to spin up a development container. It
  contains the link to the MCR image.
- `devcontainer.json`: a configuration file to customize VS Code when it runs in
  the container.

To use a container from the vscode-dev-containers repository for your own
repository, copy `Dockerfile` and `devcontainer.json` into directory
`.devcontainer`. If you need to customize the Docker image you can modify
`Dockerfile`, which contains comments with pointers on how to customize it. A
common use case for customization is installing additional Linux packages. If
you do not need to customize the Docker image, you can delete `Dockerfile` and
instead reference the Docker image in `devcontainer.json`.

Let’s look at the
[`devcontainer.json` of the GitHub repository for this website](https://github.com/maiertech/maier.tech/blob/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json):

```json:.devcontainer/devcontainer.json
{
  "name": "Next.js on javascript-node:14",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/vscode/devcontainers/javascript-node:14",
  "settings": {
    "terminal.integrated.profiles.linux": {
      "bash": {
        "path": "/bin/bash"
      }
    },
    "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux": "bash"
  },
  "extensions": ["dbaeumer.vscode-eslint", "esbenp.prettier-vscode"],
  "forwardPorts": [3000],
  "postCreateCommand": "npm i",
  "remoteUser": "node"
}
```

In this example the `image` property references a Docker image on MCR. The
`settings` property contains
[settings for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings),
in this case the shell is configured as Bash. The `extensions` property contains
IDs of VS Code extensions that should be installed into the container.
`postCreateCommand` runs `npm i` to install dependencies. Check out the
[devcontainer.json reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainerjson-reference)
for a full list of properties.

## Launch your development environment anywhere

Once you have committed directory `.devcontainer`, your repository is ready for
Codespaces. Go to [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) and
select your repository and a branch, usually `main` (if you do not have access
to Codespaces yet, you can apply [here](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
for the beta). This spins up a development container on GitHub’s cloud and
launches a fully configured VS Code instance in the browser that connects to the
container. At this point you are ready to make a commit. This works on any
machine that runs a modern browser, including
[Chromebooks](https://www.google.com/chromebook/).

If you prefer working in your locally installed VS Code, install the
[GitHub Codespaces extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces)
and connect to any of your Codespaces or launch a new one. Your development
container runs in the cloud, but it feels like developing locally. Since all the
heavy lifting is done in the cloud, even an underpowered Macbook Air makes for
an excellent development machine.

## Local development with containers

Codespaces spins up a Docker container from the configuration files added to
your repository. You can use the same configuration files to spin up a
development container on your machine and tell VS Code to use that container for
develeopment.

First you have to install
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
(`brew install docker` on Mac). Then you need to install the following two VS
Code extensions:

1. The
   [Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)
   helps you manage Docker images.
1. The
   [Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
   makes it easy to clone a GitHub repository inside a container launched from
   the configuration files inside that repository and connect to it.

I need to point out that running Docker Desktop is resource-intensive and not a
good idea if your machine is resource-stingy. But if you have a powerful enough
machine, running containers locally is a great alternative to setting up a local
development environment.

## Containers lower the barrier to contributing

In my opinion getting up and running fast when you are supposed to contribute to
a project as a developer is widely underappreciated. All too often teams accept
that spending hours or days configuring a development enviroment is inevitable.
Fiddling with a development environement is often not even a one-off, but a a
recurring issue because things break or get outdated and need to be fixed
manually by every team member.

Incomplete instructions how to install a development environment are a sure way
to frustrate new team members. They are often under pressure to contribute
quickly, yet they have to figure out by themselves how to get to the point where
they can contribute. GitHub Codespaces and developing with containers does away
with all this nonsense.

This is also great news for open source projects, because submitting a pull
request can now be as easy as spinning up a Codespaces container, making a fix
and submitting a pull request in just a few minutes. But there is another aspect
of Codespaces that is important for open source: they make contributing to open
source accessbile to more developers because owning powerful hardware to code
matters less. As long as your machine runs a modern browser you can have access
to a powerful development container.

Finally, I would like to emphasize that GitHub Codespaces is a commercial
product. Once it will be out of beta, GitHub will
[start charging for Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/about-billing-for-codespaces).
We all know that the moment you spin up a container in the cloud there is a
price tag attached to it, because it consumes hardware and power. Therefore, we
should not expect Codespaces to cost nothing. But I think GitHub needs to ensure
that there is some mechanism in place to make Codespaces affordable, because we
do not want to miss out on all the contributions to open source by developers
with limited hardware and financial resources.
