  This post shows how you optimize your lint-staged.config.js for Prettier to
  work on any supported file without having to maintain file endings.

When you use [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to run
[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) on staged
files using [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)'s pre-commit and pre-push
hooks, your `lint-staged.config.js` might look like this (or its JSON
equivalent):

```js:lint-staged.config.js
module.exports = {
  '*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}': ['eslint --fix', 'prettier --write'],
  '*.{md,mdx,css,yaml,yml}': ['prettier --write'],
};
```

This config file maintains file endings manually. If you add a file to your
project with a file ending supported by Prettier but not listed in your config,
that file will not be processed by Prettier. You have to remember to update file
endings manually in `lint-staged.config.js`.

Adding a file ending is not a big deal, but you can instead refactor
`lint-staged.config.js` to support any file endings that Prettier supports, even
future ones:

```js:lint-staged.config.js
const micromatch = require('micromatch');
const prettier = require('prettier');

// Figure out all extensions supported by Prettier.
const prettierSupportedExtensions = prettier
  .getSupportInfo()
  .languages.map(({ extensions }) => extensions)
  .flat();

const addQuotes = (a) => `"${a}"`;

module.exports = (allStagedFiles) => {
  // Match files for ESLint including dirs and files starting with dot.
  const eslintFiles = micromatch(allStagedFiles, ['**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx'], {
    dot: true,
  });

  // Match files for Prettier including dirs and files starting with dot.
  const prettierFiles = micromatch(
    allStagedFiles,
    prettierSupportedExtensions.map((extension) => `**/*${extension}`),
    { dot: true }
  );

  // Array of linters to be run in this sequence.
  const linters = [];

  // Add linters only when there are staged files for them.
  // 'prettier --write' causes lint-staged to never terminate when prettierFiles is empty.

  if (eslintFiles.length > 0)
    linters.push(`eslint --fix ${eslintFiles.join(' ')}`);

  if (prettierFiles.length > 0)
    linters.push(`prettier --write ${prettierFiles.map(addQuotes).join(' ')}`);

  return linters;
};
```

This config file exports a function that receives all staged files for
processing. This is what the config does:

1. Figure out which extensions Prettier supports.
1. Match all staged files that ESLint should process.
1. Match all staged files that Prettier can process.
1. Assemble the commands that lint-staged should run (`eslint` and/or
   `prettier`).

First I tried to do this without checking whether `prettierFiles` is empty. But
then I ran into an edge case where `prettierFiles` was empty and the pre-commit
hook would never terminate. While

```bash
eslint --fix
```

terminates correctly if it does not receive any files as argument,

```bash
prettier --write
```

displays its help page. This seems to trip up `lint-staged`.

This may still seem like overkill, but it is elegant and if you maintain shared
helpers across all of your projects, you can add this config and share it with
minimal overhead.
