title: What to do when GitHub Codespaces is down?

  GitHub Codespaces has turned out to be very reliable during the beta. I have
  moved most of my day-to-day development over to Codespaces. But every now and
  then I run into a situation where Codespaces has an outage or some other
  problem that makes it temporarily unavailalbe. In this post I share how I made
  my development workflow more resilient to ensure that a Codespaces outage does
  not grind my development workflow to a halt.

In my post
[Introduction to GitHub Codespaces](/posts/introduction-to-github-codespaces) I
described the benefits of developing with
[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) as an alternative to
developping locally. As I mentioned in that post, I had occasional issues with
Codespaces and was unable to develop for a few hours or in one instance for an
entire weekend. As frustrating as this may be, I do not expect a service that is
in beta and free of charge to be working perfectly. Therefore, I decided to
hedge against a Codespaces outage to ensure that my development workflow does
not grind to a halt.

## Plan B: Docker Desktop

A main selling point of GitHub Codespaces is that you do not have to configure a
local development environment. Therefore, it sounds counterintuitive if I
recommend keeping a local development environment ready.

In my post
[Introduction to GitHub Codespaces](/posts/introduction-to-github-codespaces/) I
explain that Codespaces are Docker containers that can be run locally. To make
this work, you need to install

1. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop),
1. VS Code
   [Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)
   and
1. VS Code
   [Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

You should keep these three around on your development machine as an insurance
against a Codespaces outage. They allow you to spin up a development container
from VS Code's remote explorer (using Docker Desktop in the background) with
your GitHub repository cloned inside. You should be up and running on your local
machine in a few minutes.

Plan B works under the assumption that your development machine is powerful
enough to run Docker Desktop. I am currently working on a 2019 Macbook Air with
16 GB RAM. Running Docker Desktop on this machine is a little ambitious and
results in a development experience that is on the sluggish side of things. But
if your machine can handle Docker Desktop, being able to run a development
container locally adds all the resilience you need.

## Plan C: Homebrew

If plan B does not work for you, you can try to setup a minimal local
development environment with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). With Homebrew, you
can install and update your development tools, such as
[Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) with minimal overhead. This works on macOS, Linux
and Windows Subsystem for Linux. All that is missing are VS Code extensions
defined in your `devcontainer.json` under the `extensions` property. You need to
install those extensions manually in your local VS Code, if you do not already
sync them via VS Code settings sync.

The goal of plan C is not to fully replicate your development container but to
install the minimums required for local development with as little effort as
possible (using Homebrew). This approach works for many projects, but not for
all. E.g. if your project requires a specific version of Node, then plan C is
not a good choice, because Homebrew only gives you the latest stable version.
You would have to install additional tools, such as
[n](https://github.com/tj/n), to manage different Node versions. But then it
would be less hassle to go with plan B, even if it comes with a performance
penalty. Unfortunately, there is no clear rule of how much effort is too much
for plan C.

## Codespaces Feedback

When you notice an issue with Codespaces that prevents you from using it, you
should hop over to
[Codespaces Feedback](https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/categories/codespaces-feedback)
to check if there are any known issues. If you do not find anything about your
issue, consider posting a message. The Codespaces team keeps an eye on
Codespaces Feedback, and the sooner they are aware of an issue, the sooner they
can fix it.

While you should not expect real time support via Codespaces Feedback, the
Codespaces team has been very responsive to every issue I posted over the past
few weeks. Here are some of the issues I had with GitHub Codespaces (linking to
the legacy Codespaces beta community) and all of them got resolved really fast:

- [Yarn installation fails](https://github.community/t/yarn-installation-fails/159455)
- [Extensions defined in devcontainer.json are not installed](https://github.community/t/extensions-defined-in-devcontainer-json-are-not-installed/156489)
- [Missing GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension](https://github.community/t/missing-github-pull-requests-and-issues-extension/144631)
- [Sluggish performance](https://github.community/t/sluggish-performance/142535)
- [Codespace terminal gets launched in wrong directory](https://github.community/t/codespace-terminal-gets-launched-in-wrong-directory/143788)
- [postCreateCommand does not run](https://github.community/t/postcreatecommand-does-not-run/142677)

## Conclusion

GitHub Codespaces is a great way to manage the configuration of your development
environment inside a GitHub repository. My experience with Codespaces during the
beta has been fantastic. Who does not enjoy developing on a development
container powered by 8 cores and 16 GB of RAM?

To brace yourself for the occasional Codespaces outage, you should figure out
how to run a Codespaces development container in your local VS Code using Docker
Desktop. Provisioning a minimal local development environment with Homebrew is
another option, which works for many projects, but not all. Unfortuantely, if
you access Codespaces via browser only, you are out of luck when there is an
outage.

Last but not least, if you run into an issue with Codespaces, you should engage
with the Codespaces team via Codespaces Feedback. The sooner they are aware of
an issue the sooner they can address it. With some luck, you may not even have
to revert to plan B or plan C when your issue gets resolved quickly.
