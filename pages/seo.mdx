# SEO guide

This SEO guide is tailored to this website, which runs on
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It is my interpretation of what good SEO
practices should look like. This guide is work in progress.

SEO traffic from [Google](https://www.google.com/) is the most important
referrer for my site. I wished referrers were more diversified, but at the
moment social media referrals are almost nonexistent. This is fairly typical for
newly launched personal websites that get a couple hundred views per month.

I hope that other sources, such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), will become
relevant referrers in the future, but until then I want to make sure that my
posts tap fully into their SEO potential. And that’s what this guide is about.

## Ground rules

- For me SEO is about increasing the chances that my posts are ranked high up in
  Google’s search results for **relevant keywords**.
- I want my audience to read my posts and not just increase the traffic to my
  website. Therefore, SEO is about **making quality content discoverable** and
  not about creating clickbait.
- The driver for my posts shoud be **genuine interest in a topic** and not a
  desire to piggyback on popular SEO keywords.

## My SEO workflow

### Step 1: Ingore SEO while shaping a post

While I shape a post, I completley ignore SEO. This step is about drafting a
post that is coherent, concise, avoids jargon and has a compelling story to tell
(in ideally less than 1,000 words). This can take anywhere between a few hours
and a few weeks. Some posts need time to mature. Since shaping a post is already
quite challenging, I do not want to deal with SEO at this point.

### Step 2: Keyword research

Once I feel good about my post, it’s time to identify keywords that increase my
chances for ranking higher in Google’s search results. To explain what I’m doing
I need to introduce two terms:

- **Short tail keywords:** Search phrases with only one or two keywords. They
  are frequently searched, but tend to result in less clickthroughs because you
  compete with established sites that have figured SEO.
- **Long tail keywords:** Search phrases with more keywords. They are less
  frequently searched and tend to result in higher clickthroughs, because you
  compete in a specialized niche.

This step is about identifying matching short tail keywords and expanding them
to long tail keywords for which it is easier to rank higher.

For my post
[Improve SEO for your Next.js site by adding canonical URLs](https://maier.tech/posts/improve-seo-for-your-next-js-site-by-adding-canonical-urls)
I started with short tail keywords _canonical url_ and typed them into Google.
This gave me an overview of my competitors, which are all established websites
with great SEO and hard to outrank.

At the bottom of a search page, Google displays related long tail keywords, e.g.
_canonical url html_ or _canonical url checker_. None of them seemed a great
match. Then I tried short tail keywords _canonical urls_ and got the following
matching (long and short tail) keywords:

- canonical url example
- canonical urls seo
- canonical link

The key in this step is to be come up with list of long tail keywords that match
the content by spending 15 minutes on creative googling and exploring related
searches.

You can make this step much more scientific by using the
[Ahrefs keyword generator](https://ahrefs.com/keyword-generator), which cranks
out a ranked list of long tail keywords and scores to indicate estimated monthly
search volumes and how hard it is to rank in the top 10 search results.

### Step 3: Add SEO metadata

General rule: place keywords rather earlier than later.

#### Title

A great title helps you improve your ranking for matching long tail keywords and
it helps you improve the clickthrough rate.

#### Description

No more than 160 characters hard limit. It takes me many iterations and a lot of
time to distill the essence of a post into less than 160 characters, which is
the maxmium that Google displays in search results. If I keep below 160
characters, Google will not truncate my description.

#### Meta keywords

You can ignore it because Google ignores it.

#### Subheadings

Subheadings are another opportunity to place matching long tail keywords.

#### Internal links

You should link to other posts on your website provided that the link provides
added value to the reader. LInked text is an opportunity to establish context
for the linked content. Avoid linking to your biggest competitors.
